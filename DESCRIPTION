Description: Support files needed for exporting Next-Generation Clustered Heat Maps (NG-CHMs)
    to '.ngchm' and '.html' files (using 'NGCHM::chmExportToFile()' and 'NGCHM::chmExportToHTML()' respectively.
    These support files are updated mostly independently from the NGCHM package, so they are
    provided separately in this package to minimize disk usage.
    The package provides two support files:
    - ShaidyMapGen.jar, which is used by both functions above to export an NGCHM, and
    - ngchmWidget-min.js, which is bundled with the NGCHM by 'NGCHM::chmExportToHTML()'.
    The package version number matches the NGCHM viewer release version number from which
    these files were built.
